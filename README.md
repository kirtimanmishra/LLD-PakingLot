#       Lower Level Design (LLD) of Parking Lot System
# This project is for Lower Level Designing of a Parking Lot system.
# This is any normal Parking Lot where vehicles can come and park at given spot if space for that vehicle type is available.
# Entry Gate is generate a ticket.
# Exit Gate will process payment.

#      Limitations:
# The code only handles single floor but extendible for multiple floors too.
# Multi-threading concepts are not implemented where multiple users try to enter through same Entry Gate or go out through same Exit Gate
